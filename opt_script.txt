In order to optimize our queries, we primarily reduced the number of inner joins on the largest tables by using subqueries in WHERE clauses rather than additional inner joins. Secondly, we created indices on multiple tables, including on artwork classification, artwork date, artist name, and artist date of birth and death. The additional classification and name indices were able to reduce our basic search time from 0.05 seconds 0.01 seconds, and our advanced search time from 4.30 seconds to 3.80 seconds.
